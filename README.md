# Prolog-learning
## [Intro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prolog)
> Prolog is a logic programming language associated with artificial intelligence and computational linguistics.

> Prolog has its roots in first-order logic, a formal logic, and unlike many other programming languages, Prolog is intended primarily as a declarative programming language: the program logic is expressed in terms of relations, represented as facts and rules. A computation is initiated by running a query over these relations.
